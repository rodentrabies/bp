;;; This file contains manual translation of the include/*.h files from
;;; libsecp256k1 as well as wrappers around API functions that accept Lisp
;;; values, translate them into foreign objects and call corresponding C
;;; functions.
;;;
;;; libsecp256k1 version:
;;;
;;;     v0.2.0 (21ffe4b22a9683cf24ae0763359e401d1284cc7a)

;;;
;;; Comments for CFFI declarations are taken directly from the libsecp256k1
;;; include/*.h files without any changes.
;;;
;;; The naming/argument conventions:
;;;
;;;   - foreign functions are named as in C (i.e. have the secp256k1 prefix)
;;;     with the exception that underscores are replaced with dash characters;
;;;     this naming is generated automatically by CFFI;
;;;
;;;   - Lisp-value wrappers have the same names as the CFFI-generated foreign
;;;     functions but the secp256k1 prefix is dropped;
;;;
;;;   - context and out arguments are fixed and omitted in Lisp functions,
;;;     length arguments are dropped, the argument order is preserved.

;;; Unless explicitly stated all pointer arguments must not be NULL.
;;;
;;; The following rules specify the order of arguments in API calls:
;;;
;;; 1. Context pointers go first, followed by output arguments, combined
;;;    output/input arguments, and finally input-only arguments.
;;; 2. Array lengths always immediately follow the argument whose length
;;;    they describe, even if this violates rule 1.
;;; 3. Within the OUT/OUTIN/IN groups, pointers to data that is typically generated
;;;    later go first. This means: signatures, public nonces, secret nonces,
;;;    messages, public keys, secret keys, tweaks.
;;; 4. Arguments that are not data pointers go last, from more complex to less
;;;    complex: function pointers, algorithm names, messages, void pointers,
;;;    counts, flags, booleans.
;;; 5. Opaque data pointers follow the function pointer they are to be passed to.
;;;

;; Opaque data structure that holds context information
;;
;; The primary purpose of context objects is to store randomization data for
;; enhanced protection against side-channel leakage. This protection is only
;; effective if the context is randomized after its creation. See
;; secp256k1_context_create for creation of contexts and
;; secp256k1_context_randomize for randomization.
;;
;; A secondary purpose of context objects is to store pointers to callback
;; functions that the library will call when certain error states arise. See
;; secp256k1_context_set_error_callback as well as
;; secp256k1_context_set_illegal_callback for details. Future library versions
;; may use context objects for additional purposes.
;;
;; A constructed context can safely be used from multiple threads
;; simultaneously, but API calls that take a non-const pointer to a context
;; need exclusive access to it. In particular this is the case for
;; secp256k1_context_destroy, secp256k1_context_preallocated_destroy,
;; and secp256k1_context_randomize.
;;
;; Regarding randomization, either do it once at creation time (in which case
;; you do not need any locking for the other calls), or use a read-write lock.

;; Opaque data structure that holds rewritable "scratch space"

;; because we target architectures where this may not be available. It is
;; essentially a resizable (within specified parameters) block of bytes,
;; which is initially created either by memory allocation or TODO as a pointer
;; into some fixed rewritable space.

;;
;; Forgery of the same message isn't universally problematic, but in systems
;; where message malleability or uniqueness of signatures is important this can
;; cause issues. This forgery can be blocked by all verifiers forcing signers
;; to use a normalized form.
;;
;; The lower-S form reduces the size of signatures slightly on average when
;; variable length encodings (such as DER) are used and is cheap to verify,
;; making it a good choice. Security of always using lower-S is assured because
;; anyone can trivially modify a signature after the fact to enforce this
;; property anyway.

;; there is no formal proof that ECDSA, even with this additional restriction,
;; is free of other malleability. Commonly used serialization schemes will also
;; accept various non-unique encodings, so care should be taken when this
;; property is required for an application.

;;; secp256k1_preallocated.h

;;; The module provided by this header file is intended for settings in which it
;;; is not possible or desirable to rely on dynamic memory allocation. It provides
;;; functions for creating, cloning, and destroying secp256k1 context objects in a
;;; contiguous fixed-size block of memory provided by the caller.
;;;
;;; Context objects created by functions in this module can be used like contexts
;;; objects created by functions in secp256k1.h, i.e., they can be passed to any
;;; API function that expects a context object (see secp256k1.h for details). The
;;; only exception is that context objects created by functions in this module
;;; must be destroyed using secp256k1_context_preallocated_destroy (in this
;;; module) instead of secp256k1_context_destroy (in secp256k1.h).
;;;
;;; It is guaranteed that functions in this module will not call malloc or its
;;; friends realloc, calloc, and free.
;;;

;; Determine the memory size of a secp256k1 context object to be created in
;; caller-provided memory.
;;
;; The purpose of this function is to determine how much memory must be provided
;; to secp256k1_context_preallocated_create.

;; aligned to hold an object of any type.
;;
;; The block of memory is exclusively owned by the created context object during
;; the lifetime of this context object, which begins with the call to this
;; function and ends when a call to secp256k1_context_preallocated_destroy
;; (which destroys the context object again) returns. During the lifetime of the
